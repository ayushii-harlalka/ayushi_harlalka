Ayushi Harlalka — Lead Data Engineer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website.

The portfolio represents my work and experience as a Lead Data Engineer, with a focus on production-grade data platforms, architecture ownership, and delivery leadership across Azure and Microsoft Fabric ecosystems.

About Me

I am a Lead Data Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing, building, and owning scalable data platforms on Azure.

I specialize in:

Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse & Data Warehouse)

Azure Data Factory and SSIS

SQL Server and Python

Analytics enablement, governance, and cost optimization

I operate at the intersection of architecture and execution, owning systems end to end — from ingestion and modeling to performance, reliability, and stakeholder delivery.
